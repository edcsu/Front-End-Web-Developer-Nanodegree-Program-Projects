## How the Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## Instructions

1. Open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.
2. Press the start button to initiate the timer.
3. By doing so, the game has started as the timer will have commenced.
    **Each turn:**
    1. The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
    2. The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding       card with the same symbol.
    3. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
    4. If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
    5. The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
